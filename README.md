# Basic Notes

Simple CRUD Telegram MiniApp developed with React that uses Telegram CloudStorage for store and deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Development Quickstart

Just make a public fork of this repository and hack away.
Your fork will be deployed to https://<USERNAME>.github.io/notes-mini-app

NOTE: Make sure **not** to change repository name when forking.
Otherwise, update `base` in [vite.config.js](./vite.config.js) and `basename` in [main.jsx](./src/main.jsx) appropriately.

## Before you start

This MiniApp make heavy use of React and React-Router-Dom JS libraries. Both of these libraries provide excellent quickstart tutorials [tic-tac-toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) for react and [contacts](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) app for react-router-dom. If you are completely unfamiliar with react and react-router-dom I would strongly encourage you skim through these pages first.
